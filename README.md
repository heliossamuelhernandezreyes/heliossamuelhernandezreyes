## About me

There are few things more rewarding than taking an idea seriously and carrying it all the way to its end.

I believe there comes a moment when an idea deserves to be shared—not out of ego, but out of responsibility. Not only a responsibility to the world, but also to oneself: the responsibility of leaving a trace, however small.

I am not a physicist. I am not an academic. I did not finish primary school. I started working as a child, and I am fully aware that there are many areas where I lack formal training. This is not a badge of honor—it is simply the reality from which I operate.

What I do have are ideas, curiosity, and something that many people with ideas in other eras did not have: tools.  
Artificial intelligence, accessible numerical modeling, open scientific literature, and the freedom to think without waiting for permission.

I do not see myself as competing with science, institutions, or the standard model. I see myself as someone exploring questions with seriousness, discipline, and intellectual honesty—using every tool this era allows.

I am a writer by nature. I build worlds, concepts, and structures—sometimes fictional, sometimes theoretical. The Omega framework is one of those ideas: strange, persistent, and demanding to be understood.

I am opposed to only one thing: the idea that contribution is impossible unless one already belongs.

My name may not sound remarkable, my background may not impress, and my path is unconventional—but the universe does not seem to care much about credentials. It responds to structure, consistency, and curiosity.
